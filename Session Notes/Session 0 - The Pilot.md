It was late into the night, the artificial sky above EPCOT the color of a television tuned to a dead channel. Hollow thuds echoed as rain pelted the exterior of [[Great Dome|the dome]] that encased the city. It is nights like these that are most dangerous, as the sounds of weather mask the gunshots that have become the characteristic music of this once utopian city. 

Though, not everyone need worry about the threat of violence in the streets. There are some who walk a higher road, one held up by the tired hands of poor man. For those people, tonight was one of celebration. [[The Disney Company]] was hosting a grand gala to celebrate the completion of their newest great [[Magic Deck|project]], a collaboration between [[WED enterprises]] and [[Disney Electronic Content]].

The halls of [[The Disney Tower]] were filled with a clash of cultures, the sleek and modern greys of the DEC executives broken up by the jewel tones characteristic of the people of [[Millennium Village]],
who run WED. 

[[Jeremiah Wotokoi]], Head of [[Disney Electronic Content Field Operations Team| Disney Electronic Content's Field Operations Team]] is idly mingling when he is approached by his acquaintance [[Elsie Davis]], who, having had one too many drinks that night, has decided to intro him to her ex boyfriend [[Anthony Atencio]]. Elsie and Jeremiah had both been working adjacent to the Magic Deck project so they had developed a friendly working relationship in over the past month or so. Alongside Jeremiah was [[Juno "D SYNC" Hyden]], former punk rocker and now mascot performer and employee of the DEC Field Operations Team.

As the four are beginning introductions, the power in the building suddenly shuts off. Murmurs echo amongst the party guests. Within the darkness, the sounds of mechanical crawling can be heard. After a few seconds, the backup generators activate and the emergency lights kick on. The door to the room has been sealed shut, and standing Infront of it are several spider drones, and one armed intruder from the [[Webhunters]] gang.

The people in the room immediately spring into action.
