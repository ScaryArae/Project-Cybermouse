## Early Epcot

Completed mostly as [[Walt]] intended, the idealistic community was for many years after its opening a true utopia with Walt at the helm. It wasn’t long before the city faced turbulence however. Frustrated with the city’s lack of privacy and forced ideologies, a group of youths held a protest that escalated into a large-scale riot occupying several neighborhoods within the city in an event that would come to be known as the [[Youth Rebellion riots]]. [[Disney]] was forced to hire a private security agency who, with  the help of Florida’s national guard, managed to quell the riots and ban most of the notable participants from the city. Following this, the disney corporation introduced the [[Epcot Police Department]]. At the time the EPD, in line with Walt’s idealistic vision, was primarily trained in de-escalation and peaceful crowd control.

## Post Youth Rebellion Riots

The riots took a heavy toll on Walt and following them his health rapidly began declining. The Disney company began, with the aid of [[Biotechnica|monsanto]], researching and developing technologies to extend human life or otherwise fend off death. Shortly after the quelling of the riots Walt passes. His body is secretly preserved in stasis using Disney’s new Bio Technology until future technological advancements can be made. Within Epcot, now left without a leader, tensions begin to rise. The Disney Corporation appoints Roy Disney Jr to act as the new mayor of Epcot.

## After Walt's Death

In the decade following Walt’s Death, the Disney corporation underwent major internal power shifts. The Company created the [[EMCO |EPCOT City Management Company]], to help manage the running of the city. Former Imagineer and now [[Mayor Marvin Davis]] was named CEO of this sub corp. Due to the cities employment rules, homeless populations began rising after layoffs caused by corporate shakups following Walts deaths. The post youth riots and now militarized EPD conducted several violent raids against encampments resulting in [[The Slums|the Slums]] beginning to developing just outside the city lines. 
## Epcot's Modernization

During the 90s, the Disney company entered their [[The Disney Renaissance|renaissance]], reviving their animation department with several critical hits, while also executing a nostalgia campaign for their classics. These things combined caused interest in EPCOT to surge and lead to mass immigration to the city, especially seeing as much of the rest of America had become far more unstable compared to a decade prior.

As the cities population rose, and public opinion of the Disney company was at an all time high, the [[Disney Adults]] poser gang began operating within the city. At first a very disorganized group of fanatics for the company, it eventually rose to be the most populous gang in all of EPCOT, controlling nearly the widest amount of territory 

While at this time the Disney Adults had not yet become a criminal organization, This mass immigration did spark the interest of organized crime families who rose to power in places such as New York and California, namely [[ The _ Family]], who saw the growing urban center as a prime location to amass power. They enter the city under the guise of a corporation named [], and gain a prime headquarters spot just outside the city center. [] also brings with them the beginnings of EPCOT’s now extensive black markets of illicit goods and activities.

 Up through the early 2000s the city was still managing to accommodate the rising populations as the outside world collapsed (the constant vacant houses as the unemployed were kicked out into the slums certainly helped.) However, by 2008 as immigration to the city continued to rise more and more fully employed workers were unable to find housing within the city and were forced to live in the slums. In 2010, EMco began orchestrating plans to urbanize the city, a dramatic shift away from the original, suburban like design of the city. These plans had been in the works since 1999 at the earliest, and by 2013 most of the space within the bounds of the city proper had become a dense urban jungle. 
 
 Despite the fact that housing issues being the public reason for this shift, much of these new developments were actually corporate buildings and office spaces. The real solution to the housing issue came in the construction of the several towering [[The Megastructures|megastructures]] around the outer bounds of the city- guaranteed housing for anyone who worked a legitimate job within the city. This "guaranteed" housing, though far from the best quality, is one of the few remains of the cities utopian beginings, and a large reason why it remains one of the preferred places to live in the united states.
