## Structure

The Epcot Police force is lead by Director [[Gauge Vazquez]] and is split into 30 units that each cover a different district of the city, as well as the [[Industrial Zone]] communities, and [[Magic Kingdom]], each designated by a number 1-30 and a two letter signifier based on where the unit serves. The units are all lead by Chiefs and are made up of anywhere between 10 and 50 individual officers, alongside a host of [[automated security forces]].

The Police forces in the [[Outer City Districts]] and the Industrial Zone are given daily arrest quotas which helps the force maintain funding by selling incarcerated individuals to overseas labor camps or private prisons.

## History

Initially the EPD was a small scale, mostly aesthetic force who acted more like security guards than a full fledged police organization. This all changed following the [[Youth Rebellion riots]] in 1977. The existing police force, completely overwhelmed, was forced to call on the Florida National Guard to assist. This move severely escalated the conflict and lead to the infamous [[Magic Kingdom Massacre]]
which saw 8 teens die after escalations lead to the National Guard firing on protesters.

After the Riots the EPD saw massive restructuring, becoming heavily militarized and much more equipped to handle civil unrest. Their training shifted as well, becoming heavily focused on preemptively suppressing civilians so that there wasn't a chance for such an uprising to occur again.

The modern structure of the force didn't emerge until EPCOTs urbanization in the early 2000s. This period also saw the force militarize more and, in the 2020s, Military Grade Cyberware became standard issue for some specialized forces with units.
## DCSRF

The Disney Cyberpsycho Response Force  also know as MAX-1, is the highest ranked unit of the EPD. The unit was created in response to the [[1938 Cyberpsycho Attacks]] and is made up of an elite force of heavily armed and cybered individuals whose sole purpose is to eliminate extreme threats. These threats are most often cyberpsychos but DCSRF has also been known to respond to extreme gang violence or rogue android attacks in Magic Kingdom
