## Early Career

Walt Disney began his career after starting a [[Iwerks-Disney Commercial Artists|company]] with colleague [[Ub Iwerks]]. This venture did not last long, and soon the pair moved to work for the Kansas City Film Ad Company. It is here that Walt became interested in [[Animation|animation]], and he eventually left the company to again form his own studio and produce short cel animations for a local theater. These films saw success and led to his newly formed studio hiring more animators.

It turned that the short form animations were not profitable enough to keep the company afloat, and after its bankruptcy in 1923, Walt moved to Los Angeles it is here where his career really began to take off, beginning with the collaboration with his [[Roy Disney|brother]] to start what would eventually become [[Disney|the Disney Company]].

## The Disney Company

Walt's company began to really take off after the development of [[Mickey Mouse]], who despite some struggle finding early success eventually helped Disney cartoons gain popularity after the development of sound cartoons. It was during this time that Walt began to distance himself from the artistic process of the work his company did, taking on a more executive and directorial role. This, of course, did not stop him from taking most of the credit for the handiwork of his artists.

After breaking ties with their initial distributer in an attempt to make higher profits on their films, Disney cartoons skyrocketed in popularity after signing a deal with Columbia Pictures which helped them see international success and eventually resulted in the film Flowers and Trees receiving an academy award after the development of technicolor animation.

## The Golden Age of Animation

For audiences, the [[Golden Age of Animation|golden age of animation]] was kicked off in 1937 with the release of Disney's [[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]. The film was revolutionary as the first feature length cell animation. Within the Disney company it had been in production since 1934, spurred by Walt's growing dissatisfaction with producing simple shorts. The production of the film saw the Disney Company pioneer many revolutionary technologies and methods for animation production, the most notable being the [[Multiplane Camera|multiplane camera]]. 

The release of snow white and subsequent Golden Age of animation saw the studio release two more full length animated projects, as well as a number of shorts. While these two films were fairly popular, both saw massive losses. This, coinciding with the onset of the world wars, marked the end of Animation's golden age in 1941.

## World Wars

The world wars marked an opportunity to further company profits in the eyes of Walt. He allocated a portion of the company to produce military training films and propaganda pieces in collaboration with the [[US government]]. This gave the company just enough money to fund their operating costs, however after the underwhelming box office release of Bambi during this time, alongside the losses from the previous two films, the Disney company was in deep financial struggle. 

This period marked a shift away from the production of animated shorts for the company, as competition within the animation industry increased and walt shifted efforts to their most profitable venture at the time of military propaganda. The studio eventually moved to incorporate more live action into their films to save on animating costs, resulting in them winning another Academy Award for a project.

## Themed Entertainment

As Walt distanced himself further and further from the film productions of his studio he began to seek other ventures. Interested in park design and themed entertainment, the man began looking for plot of land to build a [[Disneyland|theme park]]. He eventually settled on a sizable plot in Anaheim south of Burbank where the Disney company was headquartered at the time.

Worried the project might incite criticism or create friction with the Disney shareholders, walt formed [[WED enterprises]] to distance the project from the main company. He funded most of the initial venture out of pocket, hiring on what would become the legendary [[Imagineers]]. In order to tackle the part itself however, he required greater funding and after acquiring bank funding he brought on several shareholders to help finance the park.

The opening of Disneyland saw great successes, and it wasn't too long before Walt moved his sights further into engineering and spatial design. Part of this were his exhibits in the 1964 New York worlds fair, a project that in some respects served as a stepping stone for what would become the greatest project of his career: [[EPCOT]]

## The Epcot Project

EPCOT, or the experimental prototype community of tomorrow, was Walt's Vision of a livable community that was a catalyst for American industry, emerging technology, and enterprise. The project, which included not just the EPCOT but also another [[Magic Kingdom|theme park]] and much more, was a massive undertaking and required the sponsorship of several much larger corporations.

Walt sought to create an ideal city that embodied his futurist vision for society. While the plans for the development did include a theme park, that was primarily included to reassure investors following the successes of California's Disneyland. Walt's near entire focus was on his city of tomorrow.

In October 1966, Walt produced a 30 minute film that detailed his plans for the EPCOT project, explaining how the city would function and how the land would be used for the development. The purpose of this film was to convince American industry giants to sponsor the project and take part in running the city to help keep it at the forefront of technology.

The grand project was finished in the late months of 1972, and while some compromises to the plans had to be made to keep it feasible, overall it was to Walt's vision. The first year after the cities opening saw a few dozen people move into the community as permanent residents. In the two years following this, the city saw even more popularity as the first occupants publicly praised the city and encouraged others to live there. During this time walt ruled the city as a utopia that he had complete control over. This all changed in 1977 when a group of teens, having been forced to live in the city after their parents moved there, became frustrated with the lack of privacy and forced ideologies walt imposed upon the cities residents. They staged a [[Youth Rebellion riots|protest]] which eventually devolved into violent riots that lasted several days and occupied a significant portion of the city. 

The riots took a heavy toll on Walt and in the year following his health sharply declined. He became reserved, rarely showing his face to the public, and in March of 1979 he died.
## Death and Bio Technology

As it turned out, since around the time the EPCOT project was finished, Walt had been working with [[Biotechnica|Monsanto]] to experiment with life extending bio technology. While they were ultimately unsuccessful in finding a way to extend Walt's life before his passing, they were able to develop the means to preserve his body in a pseudo death stasis until further research could be done. 
## Uncle Walt

In the early 2020s the Disney company began developing an AI built around Walt's memories and his public persona. This AI "Personality" was finished in 2021, and after an extensive amount of supporting cyberware was installed into the preserved corpse, was implanted into the neural system of Walt Disney.

Alive once again, Uncle Walt was immediately declared the CEO of the company, though despite this new title this new Walt had little to no free will. The company remained controlled by its board of directors, comprised largely of the EMco Council.
