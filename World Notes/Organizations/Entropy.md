Less of a gang and more of a terrorist group, Entropy is the most vicious group in all of [[EPCOT]]. The group has complete control of [[The Slums|the Western Slums]], but their territory and actions extend far beyond that. No one knows who runs entropy, if anyone does at all. Rumor has it that the group is funded by the [New US Government](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/New_United_States) as an attempt to destabilize EPCOT and reassert control over the area from [[The Disney Company|Disney]]. Whatever the case, the fact is that it's best to stay very clear of anywhere you even think the gang might be, for few have come across them and survived.
