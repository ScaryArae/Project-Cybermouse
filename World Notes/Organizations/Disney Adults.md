A Cult like poser gang dedicated to the nostalgia and “magic” of [[The Disney Company]]. This gang operates illicit drug and weapons trade from their turf within the [[Magic Kingdom]]. Alongside this they have been known to execute attacks on anyone who is critical of the Walt Disney company, despite no actual ties to the corporation. Members often perform extreme body mods to look like classic Disney cartoon characters. The less extreme usually support advanced [cyberaudio suites](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Cyberware) and sensor arrays that look like mouse ears.
