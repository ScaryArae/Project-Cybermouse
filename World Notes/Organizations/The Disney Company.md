Evil Villain Noises

## History

As the worlds largest Media and Entertainment Corp, the Walt Disney Company has a rich legacy in the industry. Founded in 1921 by the Legendary [[Walter Elias Disney|Walt Disney]] himself, the company quickly found itself at the forefront of the animation industry. 

As time passed the company grew even further, cementing itself as an American Icon. During the world wars, the company worked with the US government to create propaganda and training films for both civilian and military audiences. These contracts allowed them to stay afloat during an otherwise dry patch in the American animation industry.

During the 1950s the company began branching out into other forms of entertainment to great success. This decade saw the production of live action films and television series as well as the beginnings of what would come to be a domination in [[Magic Kingdom|themed entertainment]].  

After the opening of [[EPCOT]] the Company shifted their headquarters to the city, originally being located in Burbank, CA. Completing and then maintaining EPCOT took a large toll on the company, something made even worse with the death of Walt Disney in 1979. Throughout the 80s the company was struggling, having to rely heavily on sponsorship from larger corporations to maintain EPCOT while staying afloat.

During the 1990s the Disney company saw a change in management and this new leader helped the corporation regain its footing. This decade saw a revival of the companies animation department which, alongside a highly successful nostalgia marketing campaign and the rest of America collapsing, caused mass immigration to EPCOT, bolstering its economy and helping Disney climb to the top of the global entertainment industry.

Throughout the 2000s the Company has grown even more, and through corporate mergers and buyouts has come to control every aspect of the American entertainment space with no serious competition as well as being at the top of the global industry.
